## 📝 **STANDARDIZED PROMPT TEMPLATE**

For testing across different codebases:
```
TASK: Add comprehensive technical documentation to the provided C code.

TARGET AUDIENCE: Experienced systems programmers who value detailed documentation (System/370 era style).

REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION:

1. FILE HEADER (at top of file):
   • Purpose and overview
   • Complete I/O specification
   • Variable dictionary (all variables)
   • Memory management notes
   • Usage examples
   • Technical debt markers
   • Algorithm descriptions

2. FUNCTION HEADERS (before each function):
   • Function signature and purpose
   • Parameter documentation (in/out/inout)
   • Return value specification
   • Local variable dictionary
   • Algorithm flow
   • Error conditions
   • Usage examples
   • Memory management
   • Security considerations

3. INLINE COMMENTS (throughout code):
   • What each section does
   • WHY design decisions were made
   • Edge cases and gotchas
   • Security implications
   • Known technical debt (marked "TECHNICAL DEBT")

STYLE: Comprehensive, old-school documentation where the comments could serve as a complete manual for the code. Every variable explained, every decision documented, every risk noted.
