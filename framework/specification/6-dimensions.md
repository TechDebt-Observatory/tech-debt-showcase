# 6-Dimensional Documentation Framework

## Overview

The 6D Framework provides a systematic approach to documenting legacy code by capturing information across six complementary dimensions.

## The Six Dimensions

### 1. Syntax Dimension
**What the code accepts and returns**
- Function signatures
- Parameter types and meanings
- Return values and error codes
- API contracts

### 2. Structure Dimension  
**How the code works internally**
- Algorithm descriptions
- Data flow
- Control flow logic
- Data structure usage

### 3. Intent Dimension
**Why the code exists and design decisions**
- Purpose and motivation
- Design rationale
- Assumptions and constraints
- Business logic context

### 4. History Dimension
**How and why the code evolved**
- Evolution timeline
- Reason for changes
- Bug fixes and their context
- Deprecated patterns

### 5. Architecture Dimension
**How code relates to the larger system**
- Component relationships
- Dependencies
- Integration points
- System-wide patterns

### 6. Technical Debt Dimension
**Known issues and improvement opportunities**
- Workarounds and their reasons
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security considerations
- Refactoring opportunities

## Application Strategy

1. Start with Syntax (what)
2. Add Structure (how)
3. Capture Intent (why)
4. Document History (evolution)
5. Map Architecture (relationships)
6. Identify Technical Debt (improvements)

## Benefits

- **For maintainers**: Faster onboarding, safer modifications
- **For AI systems**: Better vulnerability detection, accurate analysis
- **For organizations**: Reduced maintenance costs, improved security

## Measurement

Document coverage improves:
- Comment-to-code ratio
- AI comprehension scores
- Vulnerability detection rates
- Developer onboarding time
