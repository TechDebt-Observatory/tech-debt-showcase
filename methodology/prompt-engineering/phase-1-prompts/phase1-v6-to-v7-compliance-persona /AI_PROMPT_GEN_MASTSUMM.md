You are an expert **AI Governance Strategist** tasked with documenting the official transition of the "7D Framework" from version V3.x (formerly 6 Dimensions) to the new **V4.0 (7 Dimensions)**, based on our previous discussions.

Your goal is to build a high-signal, professional document titled `MASTER_SUMMARY.md` that strictly follows the below Markdown structure and content requirements.

### MASTER_SUMMARY.md Structure

# 7D Framework Version 4.0 Release Notes: The Compliance & Governance Upgrade

## 1. Release Classification
* **Previous Version:** V3.x (6 Dimensions)
* **New Version:** V4.0 (7 Dimensions)
* **Change Type:** Feature Expansion (This is a major feature addition, not an error correction.)

## 2. Core Feature Addition: Dimension 7 (Verification & Compliance)
* **Objective:** Address the systemic risk gap and enable **IEEE 1012 V&V Level 4** compliance.
* **D7 Definition:** State the definitive definition of D7 ("Certification proof and definitive system artifacts") and list its four primary artifacts (V&V Level, Symbol Dictionary, Validation Proofs, Compliance IDs).
* **Strategic Impact:** Explain how D7 makes the code *certifiable* and streamlines audit preparation. **Crucially, frame this impact by detailing how D7 addresses the needs and resistance of the following personas:**
    1.  **Junior Developer/New Maintainer:** Focus on the test of clarity (AI vs Human comprehension).
    2.  **Senior Developer/Architect:** Focus on design rationale and solving the "pay-me-later" trap.
    3.  **Auditor/Compliance Officer:** Focus on the instant traceability to V&V proof.

## 3. Structural Re-Architecture: D6 Consolidation
* **Issue Resolved:** The conflict between "Verification & Compliance" and "Diagnostics & Telemetry" was resolved to prevent an 8D framework.
* **Action Taken:** Diagnostics & Telemetry were formally integrated into Dimension 6.
* **D6 Updated Definition:** State the new, consolidated name and definition for D6.
* **Rationale:** Explain that runtime instrumentation is the primary data source for measuring D6 (Quality/Technical Debt).

## 4. Governance Model Enhancements
* **New Mandate:** The framework is an **Architectural Governance Tool** for mandatory compliance.
* **Stakeholder Impact:** Briefly summarize how D7 benefits Auditors and Organizations (e.g., reduced audit friction, certifiable codebase).
* **V&V Mapping:** Explicitly state that achieving D7 coverage is the **natural result** of following the framework and serves as the definitive proof point for IEEE 1012 compliance.
