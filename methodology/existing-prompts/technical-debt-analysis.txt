Analyze this C code for technical debt. Focus on:

1. Security vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, integer overflows, unchecked inputs)
2. Memory safety issues (leaks, use-after-free, uninitialized variables)
3. Error handling gaps
4. Type safety problems
5. Code maintainability issues
6. Complexity and readability concerns

For each issue found:
- Specify exact line numbers
- Explain the problem clearly
- Assess severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Suggest specific remediation
